# STAT107_Final_Project

Investigate how reduced sleep duration affects cognitive task performance by testing whether participants who sleep fewer hours show significantly slower reaction times and lower accuracy compared to those who get sufficient sleep. 

================================================================
Included are the following files:
================================================================

00_requirements.R - contains the required packages for our project

01_DataCleaning.rmd - contains the code to clean the raw data

02_Plots.rmd - code for the plots we will use in the final report

03_DataAnalysis.rmd - code for other analysis of data (linear regression, etc)

04_FinalReport.rmd - proper formatted final report

================================================================

Reproduce the results:

1. Run 01_DataCleaning.rmd to produce the cleaned data set

2. Run 04_FinalReport.rmd, which should not be dependent on the other files aside from the cleaned data.
