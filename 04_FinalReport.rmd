In this project we seek to analyze the effects of good sleep on a subject's cognitive performance. Do the surrounding attributes of a person's sleep, such as hours slept and caffeine intake, have a direct effect on a persons ability to perform throughout the day? And do certain attributes affect their performance more than others? These questions are of considerable importance to us as college students who want to be capable throughout the day. To answer them, we conduct statistical analysis in the form of linear regression to find the impact of each key variable in determining cognitive performance. If applied, this analysis is useful for students who wish to optimize their academic lifestyle with their sleep.

In order to answer our questions, we intend to select certain features based on highest coorelation score, intuitive choice, and possibly other methods, and train a regression model to predict the performance of a subject based on the attributes of their sleep. Furthermore, we will attempt to identify coorelations between sleep and awake performance through visualizations. As our data is observational, we cannot perform an experiment, thus we hope to identify strong coorelations in our data.

The data set in use is "human_cognitive_performance.csv" pulled from Kaggle. There are around 80,000 entries with 12 observational variables describing an individual, their sleep, and their awake performance following said sleep. To clean t
